# Terraform + PingOne DaVinci API + Sample App

## Prerequisites
- Terraform CLI installed on your computer, see [instructions](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)
- License with PingOne DaVinci product enabled
- Configure a DaVinci Administrator environment in PingOne, see [Getting Stated - PingOne DaVinci](https://terraform.pingidentity.com/getting-started/davinci/)
- After you have created a DaVinci Administrator environment you will need create a Worker App in the environment (Connections > Applications)

| .terraform | Terraform [working directory](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/init#working-directory-contents) created by Terraform. Never touch this. It's managed by Terraform. You won't see this until you run `terraform init`. |
| .terraform.lock.hcl | The Terraform [dependency lock file](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/files/dependency-lock). Where Terraform manages the versions of the downloaded providers or modules. Never touch this. It's managed by Terraform. If you need to update versions, see [-upgrade option](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/files/dependency-lock#dependency-installation-behavior). You won't see this until you run `terraform init`. |
| data.tf | HCL for doing [data](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/data-sources) lookups/reads on data in your environment/infrastructure. |
| main.tf | HCL for necessary [providers](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/providers) and [modules](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules). |
| outputs.tf | HCL declaring [output values](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/outputs) that are the result of dynamic data. In this case, the deployed apps URL. |
| resources.tf | HCL that declares all the [resources](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources) we need to create in our environment/infrastructure. The things you normally create by clicking around the PingOne admin console manually. |
| terraform.tfstate | The [Terraform state](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state) file. This is where Terraform manages the "state" of your infrastructure and compares that against your deployed infrastructure. Never touch this. It's managed by Terraform. |
| terraform.tfvars | [Variable definitions](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables#variable-definitions-tfvars-files), name/value pairs, that should not be part of your project repo and added dynamically during Terraform execution. This will not exist until you create it according to the instructions in the project-specific README. |
| vars.tf | HCL that declares [variables](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables) that will be needed in defining your environment/infrastructure. |
| versions.tf | HCL declaring [required providers](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/providers/requirements#requiring-providers) & versions to use. |


## Cloning the Project
### Variables
After cloning the project, navigate to `/davinci-api-registration-pkg/terraform` and create a `terraform.tfvars` file with the following:

```hcl
region            = "{{ NorthAmerica | Canada | Asia | Europe }}"
organization_id   = "{{orgId}}"
admin_env_id      = "{{adminEnvId}}"
admin_user_id     = "{{adminUserId}}"
license_id        = "{{licenseId}}"
worker_id         = "{{workerId}}"
worker_secret     = "{{workerSecret}}"
admin_username    = "{{adminUsername}}"
admin_password    = "{{adminPassword}}"
```

| Variable | Description | 
| -------- | ----------- |
| region | Region for PingOne Environment | 
| organization_id | PingOne Organization Id - Located under Environment -> Properties | 
| admin_env_id | PingOne Environment Id for DaVinci Administrators Environment (see prerequisites) - Located under Environment -> Properties |
| admin_user_id | User Id for a user in the DaVinci Administrators Environment (see prerequisites) - Located under Identities -> Users -> Select user -> Click API tab -> ID |
| license_id | License Id to be used for PingOne Environment |
| worker_id | Client Id for Worker App in the DaVinci Administrators Environment (see prerequisites) - Located under Connections -> Applications -> Select existing Worker App or create one -> Configuration -> Expand General -> Client ID |
| worker_secret | Client Secret for Worker App in the DaVinci Administrators Environment (see prerequisites) - Located under Connections -> Applications -> Select Worker App -> Configuration -> Expand General -> Client Secret |
| admin_username | Username for DaVinci admin user (see prerequisites) |
| admin_password | Password for DaVinci admin user (see prerequisites) |

### Deployment

##### Deploy PingOne Environment

In the command line, navigate to the `terraform` directory and run:

```code
terraform init
terraform plan
```

If the plan fails - check your `terraform.tfvars` values.

If the plan succeeds:

```code
terraform apply --auto-approve
````

Your new PingOne environment is called: `Ping DaVinci API Registration Example`

If any errors are encountered, please ensure you are using the latest version of the provider by running `terraform init -upgrade`

##### Deploy DaVinci API Registration Sample Application

In the command line, navigate to the `davinci-api-registration-sample-app` directory and run:

```code
npx http-server -S -C certs/cert.pem -K certs/key.pem
```

Access the sample application at:
https://127.0.0.1:8080

View [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) documentation for additional server options.
