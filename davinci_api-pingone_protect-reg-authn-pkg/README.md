# Terraform + PingOne DaVinci API + PingOne Protect + Signals SDK Sample App

## Prerequisites

- Terraform CLI installed on your computer, see [instructions](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)
- License with PingOne DaVinci product enabled
- Configure a DaVinci Administrator environment in PingOne, see [Getting Started - PingOne DaVinci](https://terraform.pingidentity.com/getting-started/davinci/)
- After you have created a DaVinci Administrator environment you will need create a Worker App in the environment (Connections > Applications)

## Use Case

![Use Case Diagram](./diagram.jpeg)

This integration package combines Terraform, DaVinci, PingOne Protect, and the Signals SDK to demonstrate user registration and authentication, as well as threat protection.

Terraform allows for easy and quick deployment of all platform configurations necessary to run this sample application.

During the deployment process, Terraform will create a new PingOne environment with DaVinci and PingOne Protect services enabled. The DaVinci environment gets created with a flow that demonstrates a registration and password authentication use case. In this flow, a risk evaluation is created by a call made to the PingOne Protect APIs. The sample application initializes the Signals SDK and sends the risk payload to DaVinci to be used in the risk evaluation call when registration or authentication is initiated.

### Registration

1. Start the sample app and navigate to the URL provided.
2. Complete the registration form with an email address and password. Click **Submit**.
3. If a user with this password does not already exist in PingOne Directory, the user will get created and will land on the /dashboard endpoint. The email used to register will be displayed on the dashboard page, as well as the risk score and response received from the PingOne Protect API for this transaction.
4. Click **Logout** to return to the homepage and register a new user, or to demonstrate sign in.

### Sign In as an Existing User

1. Start the sample app and navigate to the URL provided.
2. Complete the registration instructions above to create a new user, if you have not already done so.
3. Complete the form with the credentials for the user created in step 2. Click **Submit**.
4. You will be signed in and landed on the /dashboard endpoint. The email used to login will be displayed on the dashboard page, as well as the risk score and response received from the PingOne Protect API for this transaction.
5. Click **Logout** to return to the homepage and register a new user, or to demonstrate sign in.

### Deployment

##### Deploy PingOne Environment

In the command line, navigate to the `/terraform` folder and run:

```code
export PINGONE_REGION="{{ NorthAmerica | Canada | AsiaPacific | Europe }}"
terraform init
terraform plan
```

If the plan fails - check your `terraform.tfvars` values.

If the plan succeeds:

```code
terraform apply --auto-approve
```

Your new PingOne environment is called: `DaVinci API Protect Example`

##### Deploy the Sample Application

In the command line, navigate to the `/sample-app` folder and run:

```code
npx http-server -S -C certs/cert.pem -K certs/key.pem
```

Access the sample application at:
https://127.0.0.1:8080

View [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) documentation for additional server options.
