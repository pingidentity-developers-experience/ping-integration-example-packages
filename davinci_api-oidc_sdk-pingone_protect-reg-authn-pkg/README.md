# Terraform + PingOne SSO + PingOne DaVinci + PingOne Protect + Signals SDK Sample App

## Prerequisites
- Terraform CLI installed on your computer, see [instructions](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)
- License with PingOne DaVinci product enabled
- Configure a DaVinci Administrator environment in PingOne, see [Getting Stated - PingOne DaVinci](https://terraform.pingidentity.com/getting-started/davinci/)
- After you have created a DaVinci Administrator environment you will need create a Worker App in the environment (Connections > Applications)

## Use Case

![Use Case Diagram](./diagram.jpeg)

This integration package combines Terraform, DaVinci, PingOne SSO, PingOne Protect, the Signals SDK, and the OIDC SDK to demonstrate user registration and authentication, as well as threat protection.

Terraform allows for easy and quick deployment of all platform configurations necessary to run this sample application. 

During the deployment process, Terraform will create a new PingOne environment with DaVinci, PingOne SSO, and PingOne Protect services enabled. The DaVinci environment gets created with a flow that demonstrates a registration and password authentication use case. In this flow, the Signals SDK is initiated in a custom HTML template, the response from the SDK is then sent in a call to the PingOne Protect API to create a risk evaluation. The sample application uses the OIDC SDK to initiate the authentication flow for the OIDC application in PingOne which uses a DaVinci policy created by Terraform. After the DaVinci flow is successfully completed, the user is redirected back to the sample app.

### Registration
1. Start the sample app and navigate to the URL provided.
2. Click on the link to Login and complete the username form. Click **Next**.
3. If a user with this username does not already exist in PingOne Directory, a registration form will be presented.
4. Fill out all fields of the registration form, click **Register**. The user will get created and will land on the /dashboard endpoint. The email used to register will be displayed on the dashboard page, as well as the user's tokens, user info, and risk score.
5.. Click **Logout** to return to the homepage and register a new user, or to demonstrate sign in. 

### Sign In as an Existing User
1. Start the sample app and navigate to the URL provided.
2. Complete the registration instructions above to create a new user, if you have not already done so. 
3. Click on the link to Login and complete the username form with the user created in step 2. Click **Next**.
3. Fill in the user's password. Click **Sign On**.
4. You will be signed in and landed on the /dashboard endpoint. The email used to login will be displayed on the dashboard page, as well as the user's tokens, user info, and risk score.
4. Click **Logout** to return to the homepage and register a new user, or to demonstrate sign in.

## Cloning the Project
### Variables
After cloning the project, navigate to `/davinci-sso-protect-pkg/terraform` and create a `terraform.tfvars` file with the following:

```hcl
region            = "{{ NorthAmerica | Canada | Asia | Europe }}"
organization_id   = "{{orgId}}"
admin_env_id      = "{{adminEnvId}}"
admin_user_id     = "{{adminUserId}}"

### Deployment

##### Deploy PingOne Environment

In the command line, navigate to the `terraform` directory and run:

```code
export PINGONE_REGION="{{ NorthAmerica | Canada | Asia | Europe }}"
terraform init
terraform plan
```

If the plan fails - check your `terraform.tfvars` values.

If the plan succeeds:

```code
terraform apply --auto-approve
````

Your new PingOne environment is called: `DaVinci SSO Protect Example`

If any errors are encountered, please ensure you are using the latest version of the provider by running `terraform init -upgrade`

##### Deploy DaVinci SSO Protect Sample Application

In the command line, navigate to the `davinci-sso-protect-app` directory and run:

```code
npx http-server -S -C certs/cert.pem -K certs/key.pem
```

Access the sample application at:
https://127.0.0.1:8080

View [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) documentation for additional server options.
