# OIDC SDK + Terraform + PingOne Sample App Package

## Use Case

![Use Case Diagram](./diagram.jpeg)

This integration package combines Terraform, PingOne, and the OIDC SDK to demonstrate user registration and authentication.

Terraform allows for easy and quick deployment of all platform configurations necessary to run this sample application. 

During the deployment process, Terraform will create a new PingOne environment with the PingOne SSO service enabled. When authentication is initiated from the sample app, the OIDC SDK is used to redirect the user to the authorization endpoint for the newly created OIDC application in PingOne. The user returns to the sample app after successful authentication, and the SDK stores their tokens in storage and displays them to the user.

### Registration
1. Start the sample app and navigate to the URL provided.
2. Click on the link to Login. Click **No account? Register Now!**
3. Complete all fields of the registration form, click **Save**. 
4. Enter the verification code sent to you via email, click **Verify**. The user will get created and will land on the /dashboard endpoint. The user's access token, id token, and user info will be displayed on the dashboard page.
5. Click **Logout** to return to the homepage and register a new user, or to demonstrate sign in. 

### Sign In as an Existing User
1. Start the sample app and navigate to the URL provided.
2. Complete the registration instructions above to create a new user, if you have not already done so. 
3. Click on the link to Login and fill in the credentials for the user created in step 2. Click **Sign On**. You will be signed in and landed on the /dashboard endpoint. The user's access token, id token, and user info will be displayed on the dashboard page.
4. Click **Logout** to return to the homepage and register a new user, or to demonstrate sign in.

## Getting Started
Install Terraform on your machine, following the instructions [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads).

## Cloning the Project
### Variables
After cloning the project, navigate to `/oidc_sdk-reg-authn-pkg/terraform` and create a `terraform.tfvars` file with the following:

```hcl
region          = "{{ NorthAmerica | Canada | Asia | Europe }}"
organization_id = "{{orgId}}"
admin_env_id    = "{{adminEnvId}}"
admin_user_id   = "{{adminUserId}}"
license_id      = "{{licenseId}}"
worker_id       = "{{workerId}}"
worker_secret   = "{{workerSecret}}"
```

| Variable | Description | 
| -------- | ----------- |
| region | Region for PingOne Environment | 
| organization_id | PingOne Organization Id - Located under Environment -> Properties | 
| admin_env_id | PingOne Environment Id for Administrators Environment - Located under Environment -> Properties |
| admin_user_id | User Id for a user in the Administrators Environment - Located under Identities -> Users -> Select user -> Click API tab -> ID |
| license_id | License Id to be used for PingOne Environment |
| worker_id | Client Id for Worker App in the Administrators Environment - Located under Connections -> Applications -> Select existing Worker App or create one -> Configuration -> Expand General -> Client ID |
| worker_secret | Client Secret for Worker App in the Administrators Environment - Located under Connections -> Applications -> Select Worker App -> Configuration -> Expand General -> Client Secret |

### Deployment

##### Deploy PingOne Environment

In the command line, navigate to the `terraform` directory and run:

```code
export PINGONE_REGION="{{ NorthAmerica | Canada | Asia | Europe }}"
terraform init
terraform plan
```

If the plan fails - check your `terraform.tfvars` values.

If the plan succeeds:

```code
terraform apply --auto-approve
````

Your new PingOne environment is called: `Ping OIDC SDK Example`

If any errors are encountered, please ensure you are using the latest version of the provider by running `terraform init -upgrade`

##### Deploy OIDC Sample Application

In the command line, navigate to the `oidc-sdk-sample-app` directory and run:

```code
npx http-server -S -C certs/cert.pem -K certs/key.pem
```

Access the sample application at:
https://127.0.0.1:8080

View [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) documentation for additional server options.

##### Deploy Using an Existing PingOne Environment
If you prefer not to use Terraform to create a PingOne environment for you, you can configure this package to use an existing PingOne environment by following the instructions below.

Navigate to the `index.html` and `dashboard.html` files in the `/oidc-sdk-sample-app` directory, and update the following values with your PingOne values:

| Variable | Description | 
| -------- | ----------- |
| pingOneEnvId | PingOne Environment Id | 
| clientId | Application Client Id |
| redirectUri | Redirect URI, this will be https://127.0.0.1:8080/dashboard.html |

Note: The Administrators environment cannot be used for this.

In the command line, navigate to the `oidc-sdk-sample-app` directory and run:

```code
npx http-server -S -C certs/cert.pem -K certs/key.pem
```

Access the sample application at:
https://127.0.0.1:8080
